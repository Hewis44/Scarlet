## 10/21/2025 - Plan and Research ( binge watched yt )  

So today I started working on this really fun idea for an event called Blueprint where I am planning to make a robotic arm that can actually play chess with me. The concept is to design a SCARA style arm that moves pieces around the board just like a human hand.

I got this idea after watching a few chess playing robots online but most of them were using magnets under the board or bulky frames that looked more like machines than something interactive. I wanted mine to look open and mechanical so people can actually see it lift the chess pieces and place them with smooth motion. I spent some time reading about different types of robotic arms and SCARA stood out because it is fast compact and easier to control compared to those six axis industrial arms.

also looked into how people calculate inverse kinematics for SCARA arms and how stepper motors are controlled using microcontrollers. My plan is to 3D design the entire structure in Fusion 360 using lightweight materials and 3D printed joints that can be assembled easily. The model I have made till now looks quite neat with those perforated arms and a gripper end effector that can pick up small chess pieces. I want to later add a camera or some kind of vision system so it can detect the chessboard and make moves intelligently. For now I am focusing on getting the mechanics and electronics right so that the movement feels natural and not jerky. Honestly it feels amazing to watch the design slowly take shape on screen and I can already imagine it sitting on a table at the event playing a real chess match with someone while people gather around to watch.
